Our company has been in business since 1965. We began as a division of another company and moved out as a separate company in 1986.

We strive to provide our customers with high quality communications equipment, price value, consistent performance, and exceptional service by people who care.

We are a member of the Oklahoma Restaurant Association (ORA) National Systems Contractors Association (NSCA) and the International Business Music Association (IBMA).

Although GLP is a locally owned Oklahoma company, we are well versed in taking care of national accounts and doing installations and service nationwide. Our philosophy is that outstanding customer service is the key to success.
